stadion;	stadium venue where sporting events are held stadion stadium, arena stadium A Greek unit of measurement, equivalent to six plethra or six hundred podes, which, though varying in precise length, is generally accepted to be equivalent to approximately metres. The winner of the Stadion race could justifiably be called the fastest man in the Greek world. According to legend, Herakles, whose feet were meters inches long, stepped-off the Stadion at Olympia. Since he chose a distance of feet, this made the race at Olympia meters. Herakles staged a race for his brothers, the Kouretes, and crowned the victor with a branch of wild olive. Although the Greek Stadion race was always feet, other Greek gods had feet of different lengths. This caused the length of the Stadion race to vary slightly from stadium to stadium. This list of Olympic victors compiled by Hippias in about B.C. lists the Stadion race as the only event in the first Olympic games. Coreobus of Elis, a cook, was the victor in the Stadion race in B.C. and thus the first recorded Olympic victor. The stadion was used specifically for human athletic contests whereas the Greek hippodrome and later the Roman circus were used for equestrian events. The gymnasion and the palaistra were used for training purposes for human athletic events. Stadion Race meters The stadion did not suffice for the races of horses and chariots which had been favorites with the Greeks since the Trojan war. units of measure.

potential;	Being potent. endowed with energy adequate to a result. efficacious. influential. Referring to a verbal construction of form stating something is possible or probable. A potential flow is an irrotational flow. A verbal construction or form stating something is possible or probable. potential The gravitational potential is the radial irrotational, static component of a gravitational field, also known as the Newtonian potential or the gravitoelectric field. Novello, M. VII Brazilian School of Cosmology and Gravitation, Rio de Janeiro, August Atlantica S guier Fronti res,, p. nbsp. In general, a system can have both translational and rotational accelerations, however. It follows from Einstein s principle of equivalence that locally i.e., to the extent that spacetime curvature can be neglected gravitational effects are the same as inertial effects. therefore, gravitation can be approximately described in terms of gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic fields corresponding to translational and rotational inertia, respectively. This is the gravitational Larmor theorem, which is very useful in the post-Newtonian approximation to general relativity. The gravitomagnetic field of a massive rotating body is a measure of its absolute rotation. Thorne, Kip S.

Freeman and Company, New York,, pp.,, From our electrodynamical experience we can infer immediately that any rotating spherical body e.g., the sun or the earth will be surrounded by a radial gravitoelectric Newtonian field g and a dipolar gravitomagnetic field H. The gravitoelectric monopole moment is the body s mass M. the gravitomagnetic dipole moment is its spin angular momentum S. Gr n, yvind. Hervik, Sigbj rn Einstein s General Theory of Relativity with Modern Applications in Cosmology Springer,, p. In the Newtonian theory there will not be any gravitomagnetic effects. the Newtonian potential is the same irrespective of whether or not the body is rotating. Hence the gravitomagnetic field is a purely relativistic effect. The gravitoelectric field is the Newtonian part of the gravitational field, while the gravitomagnetic field is the non-Newtonian part. Currently unrealized ability. The work required to bring a unit positive electric charge from an infinite distance to a specified point against an electric field. A potential field is an irrotational static field. Existing in possibility, not in actuality. Even from a young age it was clear that she had great musical potential.
