HE FOUND THAT HE NO LONGER HATED <UNK> ( HE KNEW HOW MUCH HE HAD HATED HER ) , AND HE WAS SURPRISED AT A <UNK> OF AN <UNK> FEELING .

THIS MEASUREMENT WAS OBTAINED BY W. <UNK> OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA , <UNK> , BY <UNK> THE <UNK> OF THE FREE <UNK> <UNK> SIGNAL .

HIS <UNK> BEGINS AS A DEFENSE AGAINST <UNK> .
FROM THE <UNK> POINT OF VIEW , THIS STRANGE <UNK> ON THE BACK OF ANOTHER <UNK> , <UNK> OUT WITH ITS LONG THIN <UNK> , VERY LIKELY APPEARED AS SOMETHING SHE COULD NOT AT FIRST COPE WITH .

HE CALLED HER `` <UNK> '' .
THE CRIME SHOWED TOO MUCH PLANNING , THE <UNK> APPEARED TOO <UNK> TO BE CAUGHT BY A <UNK> .
HOWEVER , THERE IS A CRUCIAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO <UNK> .

`` RIGHT '' , SAID THE <UNK> MAN .

THE <UNK> <UNK> ON <UNK> MAIN STREET COMPARE <UNK> WITH THOSE IN <UNK> AND NEW <UNK> .
ONE INDICATION OF THE <UNK> OF THE NEW MANAGEMENT IS FOUND IN THE FACT THAT DURING THE PERIOD <UNK> , WHILE TOTAL ANNUAL <UNK> PUT ON THE VEHICLES INCREASED <UNK> , THE TOTAL MAINTENANCE COST INCREASED ONLY <UNK> .
WITHOUT <UNK> , <UNK> PASSED A BILL BY SEN. A. R. <UNK> OF <UNK> <UNK> ESTABLISHMENT IN THE FUTURE OF A SCHOOL FOR THE <UNK> <UNK> IN THE GULF COAST DISTRICT .

MITCHELL WAS FOR USING IT , JONES AGAINST , AND SEN. <UNK> <UNK> JR. <UNK> DID NOT MENTION IT WHEN THE THREE REPUBLICAN <UNK> CANDIDATES SPOKE AT <UNK> INTERVALS BEFORE 100 PERSONS AT THE PARK HOTEL .

FORTUNATELY , I KNEW ALMOST EXACTLY WHAT THE WILL HAD SAID .
THEN I SPOKE AT THE <UNK> <UNK> PARTY OF W. E. <UNK> DU <UNK> , WHO <UNK> ON A <UNK> <UNK> AT <UNK> AND WHO , WITH THE CRISIS , HAD CREATED A NEGRO <UNK> THAT HAD NEVER EXISTED IN AMERICA BEFORE HIM .

AND SO WHEN THE OTHERS <UNK> OUT THAT AFTERNOON JACK REMAINED <UNK> IN HIS SEAT NEAR A WINDOW , LOOKING OUT IN WHAT HE HOPED WAS A <UNK> MANNER , WHILE THE OTHER KIDS LAUGHED AND YELLED IN AT HIM AND MADE FACES AS THEY <UNK> , GOING HOME .
NOW <UNK> , FOR INSTANCE , WAS NOT TOO LONG ON SYMPATHY .
`` THIS REVEALS SOME <UNK> ON YOUR PART .
THERE WAS A BATTLE ON AN AVERAGE OF ONCE EVERY THREE WEEKS .

THE NEW <UNK> SCHEDULE ALSO WAS SUPPORTED BY <UNK> OF <UNK> AND <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> AND HEALTH <UNK> EUGENE A. <UNK> .
HE EXAMINED THE WATER MARKS ON THE IRON <UNK> WHEN THE ANIMALS WERE FINISHED .
<UNK> THE <UNK> CHANGING IMAGES TOGETHER , THE EYE ITSELF <UNK> THEM WITH THE ILLUSION OF MOVEMENT .

WHY ' '' ? ?
THE <UNK> OF NATIONALISM HAD BROUGHT DOWN UPON EUROPE A GENERATION OF <UNK> AND WAR , AND A RETURN TO THE OLD ORDER OF THINGS SEEMED <UNK> .
TRY TO FORGET MOTIVE FOR THE MOMENT .
FOR THIS CHANGE IS NOT A CHANGE FROM ONE POSITIVE POSITION TO ANOTHER , BUT A CHANGE FROM ORDER AND TRUTH TO <UNK> AND <UNK> .
THE PLACE OF RELIGION IN THE SIMPLE , <UNK> SOCIETIES IS QUITE DEFINITE ; ;
ALWAYS , IN THE <UNK> ATTACKS UPON <UNK> RECORD , ONE MAN ALONE -- A <UNK> <UNK> ( <UNK> IN <UNK> ) OR A <UNK> <UNK> ( <UNK> IN <UNK> ) OR A <UNK> WILSON ( <UNK> IN <UNK> ) -- MADE THE BID .
THEN HE HEARD IT , LIKE A <UNK> <UNK> , FELT A SUBTLE CHANGE IN AIR PRESSURE .
AT THE SAME TIME , IT WAS UNLIKELY THAT ANY <UNK> WOULD SPEND A DAY IN A CHRISTIAN MISSION OUT OF MERE CURIOSITY .
AFTER <UNK> DEATH IN <UNK> <UNK> WROTE : `` MAY HE REST IN PEACE WITH THE ETERNAL <UNK> OF HIS ADOPTED COUNTRY '' .
<UNK> <UNK> <UNK> UNDER HER FEET ; ;
PUBLIC <UNK> AND RESISTANCE TO <UNK> INCREASES IS OBVIOUSLY MUCH LESS WHEN THE INCREASES ARE ON THE ORDER OF <UNK> PER <UNK> THAN WHEN THE INCREASES ARE ON THE ORDER OF <UNK> PER MONTH .
THEY WERE ALWAYS DENIED .
THERE WERE <UNK> <UNK> AND <UNK> BURNS ON OUR HANDS ; ;
DONE BY A PROFESSIONAL <UNK> , <UNK> THOUGHT , AND SOMEHOW AS <UNK> , AS <UNK> AS ITS <UNK> .

`` THAT'S THE COLONEL '' , HE SAID , `` BUT I CAN'T SEE THE DOGS '' .
<UNK> AUTO WITH A <UNK> MAGAZINE THAT HOLDS 18 LONG RIFLES .
FINALLY , IF THE MISSION OF THE TRIAL WAS TO <UNK> ANTI-SEMITISM , HOW COULD IT HAVE FAILED TO POST BEFORE THE WORLD THE <UNK> <UNK> OF THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH THE FINAL SOLUTION WAS <UNK> BY NATIVE <UNK> -- I.E. , GERMANY , POLAND , <UNK> , <UNK> -- AND THOSE IN WHICH IT MET THE <UNK> OF HUMAN <UNK> -- <UNK> , <UNK> , ITALY , <UNK> , FRANCE ? ?

THOUGH HIS ELECTION WAS INTERPRETED BY MANY SOUTHERNERS AS THE <UNK> OF A DANGEROUS SHIFT IN THE FEDERAL BALANCE IN FAVOR OF THE UNION , LINCOLN HIMSELF PROPOSED NO SUCH CHANGE IN THE RIGHTS THE CONSTITUTION GAVE THE STATES .
AND THIS WAS BEFORE HE BEGAN TO PLAY HIS <UNK> BEAUTIFUL JAZZ .
RESOLVED THAT THE <UNK> SENTIMENT IS BECOMING <UNK> FOR <UNK> ACTION .
AS AMERICA ON WHEELS WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR AN INDUSTRY OF MOTOR COURTS , <UNK> , AND <UNK> <UNK> WHERE YOU CAN <UNK> , SEE A MOVIE , SHOP , OR MAKE A BANK <UNK> , THE <UNK> NUMBER OF <UNK> <UNK> HAVE <UNK> INDUSTRIES DESIGNED ESPECIALLY TO <UNK> THEM .
LET <UNK> KEEP THE FIRM SEAT ; ;
AS SHE DROVE , SHE THOUGHT ABOUT HER PLAN .
DR. <UNK> WAS SO PLEASED WITH THE QUALITY OF HER <UNK> STUDY OF <UNK> <UNK> THAT HE CONSIDERED <UNK> IT TO THE CENTURY MAGAZINE OR <UNK> BUT HE DECIDED THAT ITS JEWISH SUBJECT PROBABLY WOULD NOT INTEREST THEM AND PUBLISHED IT IN THE <UNK> , `` SO OUR READERS WILL BE <UNK> INSTEAD '' .

THE EFFECT IS AS IF HE HAD <UNK> OUT OF NOWHERE .
HE IS NOT ONE TO REMAIN MORE <UNK> AND <UNK> WITHIN A BODY OF SOCIAL , CULTURAL , OR LITERARY TRADITIONS THAN HE WAS WITHIN THE TRADITIONS -- OR POSSIBLY THE REGULATIONS -- GOVERNING HIS <UNK> IN THE POST OFFICE AT <UNK> , MISSISSIPPI , <UNK> YEARS AGO .
CONTRARY TO USUAL <UNK> <UNK> , THE POSITION TO WHICH <UNK> MEMBERS REPORT <UNK> WILL NOT NECESSARILY <UNK> THE DUTIES OF THE <UNK> MEMBER , THEREFORE , ARE NOT NECESSARILY <UNK> AS HIGHLY .
INSTEAD OF A <UNK> HE WORE A <UNK> <UNK> DRAWN THROUGH A GOLDEN RING IN WHICH WAS SET A <UNK> OF PALE PURE <UNK> .
HE HAD NEVER HEARD THE WORD REACTIONARY BEFORE HIS LIFE AS A <UNK> BEGAN .

IN WHAT HAS <UNK> BEEN CALLED A `` CONSTITUTIONAL REVOLUTION '' , THE BASIC NATURE OF GOVERNMENT WAS TRANSFORMED FROM ONE ESSENTIALLY NEGATIVE IN NATURE ( THE `` <UNK> STATE '' ) TO ONE WITH <UNK> DUTIES TO PERFORM .
THEY HAVE REMAINED ON THE OPENED PAGE OF MY MIND IN ALL THE YEARS WHICH SINCE HAVE PASSED .
ONLY <UNK> ( 11 SUBJECTS ) GAVE A POSITIVE <UNK> REACTION WHEN COMPLETELY <UNK> CONCERNING THE PHENOMENON .
ALL OF THEM FELT A <UNK> NEED FOR MORE COVERAGE ON AREAS THAT COULD BE ONLY LIGHTLY TOUCHED UPON IN A GENERAL SURVEY FUNCTIONAL COURSE .
<UNK> <UNK> SHOULD HAVE LOOKED AT SOME OF THE OLD SILENT FILMS WHERE THEY REALLY HAD PARTIES ! !

THOUGH ONLY A RELATIVELY SHORT WALK SEPARATED IT FROM MY OWN PART OF TOWN , ITS CHARACTER WAS WHOLLY FOREIGN TO ME .
AND A <UNK> PEAS WOULD FILL ALL THE BUILDINGS IN THE CITY OF PHILADELPHIA .
THEY BOTH MEASURE LITERATURE BY MORAL STANDARDS , AND IN THEIR POLITICAL <UNK> BOTH ALLOW FOR <UNK> , BUT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THEM ARE ALSO SIGNIFICANT .
HE WILL KNOW THAT GENERAL POLICY PAPERS WRITTEN MONTHS BEFORE MAY NOT FIT HIS PROBLEM BECAUSE OF CRUCIAL CHANGES IN <UNK> .
AT THE SAME TIME HE STARTED WALKING THE STREETS , <UNK> AT THE PEOPLE PASSING OR SHOPPING AT THE <UNK> , <UNK> UP FRESH IMPRESSIONS OF WHAT THEY LOOKED LIKE , HOW THEY MOVED .
HE TOSSED THE BAG INTO THE <UNK> AND WATCHED DRY DUST <UNK> UP AROUND IT .
PARTLY BECAUSE <UNK> HEAT TREATMENT IS NEEDED TO <UNK> <UNK> BEFORE <UNK> , TREATED FRESH <UNK> HAVE THE APPEARANCE OF <UNK> OR <UNK> MEAT .
THAT WAS MORE LIKE A THOUGHT , BUT NOT A GREAT DEAL MORE .
IN EARLIER CENTURIES MEN HAD HAD ENOUGH TO DO IN <UNK> A FUNDAMENTAL SENSE OF ORDER AFTER <UNK> .
THE <UNK> <UNK> IS THE CONVENTIONAL <UNK> OF <UNK> HUMANITY ; ;
THAT FAILED .

THE OTHER HAD ASSUMED THE RIGHT TO <UNK> THE EQUALLY <UNK> SPACE OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT .

IT IS ONE OF THE VERY FEW NEW THINGS IN UTOPIA ; ;
WHILE THIS MAY WELL BE TRUE IN GENERAL , I BELIEVE IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND THAT SOME RECENT DEVELOPMENTS SUGGEST THAT OVER THE NEXT YEAR OR SO MILITARY ELECTRONICS MAY BE ONE OF THE MOST STRONGLY GROWING AREAS IN AN ECONOMY WHICH IS NOT EXPANDING RAPIDLY IN OTHER DIRECTIONS .
PRESENTLY , SHE PICKED UP THE FIRST OF THE LETTERS .

HIS SECOND WIFE , <UNK> , WAS THE MOTHER OF JOHN H. MERCER .
I ASKED <UNK> WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF HE BROKE OUT THE GO <UNK> AND TRIED TO START <UNK> ONE .
IT WILL BE RECALLED FROM THE DISCUSSION IN SECTION 7 THAT THE POSITION OF THE `` RIGHT '' , AS REPRESENTED BY <UNK> , <UNK> ON THE FOLLOWING <UNK> : THE ONLY <UNK> ALTERNATIVE TO <UNK> POSITION IS A <UNK> THAT ( 1 ) <UNK> OR AT LEAST <UNK> HIS <UNK> DEMAND FOR <UNK> AND <UNK> INTERPRETATION ; ;
IT WAS FUNNY BUT IT WAS ALSO <UNK> .
AS SEEN IN THE B. FAMILY , THERE MUST BE AN ATTEMPT TO HELP THE <UNK> DEVELOP CONSCIOUS AWARENESS OF THE PROBLEM , ESPECIALLY IN THE ABSENCE OF A FORMAL REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE .
TURNING TO THE REPORTERS , SHE ASKED , `` DID YOU HEAR HER ? ?
AS IN A RECENT DESIGN COMPETITION WITH A FLOOR PLAN AND THE SIMPLE COMMAND -- `` DESIGN A LUXURY APARTMENT '' ; ;

SHE STARTED BACK FOR THE HOUSE , SAW A LIGHT IN THE OFFICE , OPENED THE DOOR AND SURPRISED A DOMESTIC LITTLE SCENE WHICH WAS FAR OUTSIDE THE DARK <UNK> OF MURDER OR ATTEMPTED MURDER .

THERE IS AN EXTRAORDINARY SENSE OF PRESENCE IN ALL OF THESE <UNK> , APPARENTLY OBTAINED AT LEAST IN PART BY <UNK> THE MIDDLE AND HIGH FREQUENCIES .
THE INNER PANELS DO NOT HAVE TO BE <UNK> , AND THE CHOICE WILL DEPEND ON THE QUALITY OF FINISH DESIRED .
<UNK> HE WALKED ME BACK TO <UNK> HOUSE WITHOUT A WORD PASSING BETWEEN US .
`` WE'VE GOT TO EAT '' , SARAH SAID , <UNK> , BECAUSE A <UNK> <UNK> OVER HER AGAIN .
AND I WOULD FURTHER NOTE THAT THEY ALL -- WITH ONE EXCEPTION AGAIN -- SANG IN ONE KEY OR ANOTHER THE SAME SONG .
THE BASIC DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CONTINUOUS CUTTING MECHANISM AND THAT OF THE <UNK> MECHANISM IS THAT INSTEAD OF SHEAR OCCURRING IN THE COATING AHEAD OF THE KNIFE CONTINUOUSLY WITHOUT <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> OCCURS ALONG THE SHEAR PLANE .

THE WORK OF <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> DU CONGO <UNK> ( <UNK> ) HAS SPECIAL INTEREST WITH RESPECT TO <UNK> .
BUT HIS OWN WORK WAS <UNK> FURTHER .
`` THIS IS NOT A PROGRAM OF <UNK> MEDICINE .
THE <UNK> CAPACITY TO <UNK> ACHIEVEMENT AND TO EXERCISE THE <UNK> NECESSARY TO COMPLETE TASKS SUCCESSFULLY DEPENDS ON THE DEGREE TO WHICH HE OR SHE DEVELOPED <UNK> , INITIATIVE , AND <UNK> DURING CHILDHOOD .
<UNK> WAS <UNK> WITH RITUAL <UNK> , THE MARK OF A TRUE GENTLEMAN .
I CRIED .
THE <UNK> , KEPT WARM BY THE QUEEN , ARE FULL GROWN IN ABOUT TEN DAYS .
<UNK> TUBES HAVE BEEN CONSTRUCTED SHOWING HIGH GAIN AND RESOLUTION .
NOW , THE PICTURE IS <UNK> , AND EVEN US <UNK> JAMES O. <UNK> AND JOHN C. <UNK> , WHO REMAINED <UNK> TO THE <UNK> , ARE UNCERTAIN OF THEIR STATUS .
THE PROPERTY INCLUDED A <UNK> <UNK> MANUFACTURING BUILDING ON <UNK> SQUARE FEET OF LAND .

`` I'VE BEEN <UNK> UP SO LONG '' , HE ADDED .
HE WAS <UNK> WITH ANGER , HIS BREATH COMING IN LONG , PAINFUL <UNK> .
AND EVEN ON <UNK> ASSUMPTIONS THAT DOES NOT SEEM VERY BRIGHT .
THE SUN WAS NOON HIGH AND MATSUO <UNK> UNTIL HIS BODY WAS <UNK> .

FOR THE SAD TRUTH IS THAT WHILE ONE MIGHT WRITE WELL WITHOUT HAVING READ <UNK> THE <UNK> , ONE IS MORE LIKELY , TO WRITE WELL IF ONE HAS `` READ IT , AND MUCH ELSE .
HE WAS NOT GOING TO LOSE THE MISSION BY <UNK> , AND WHATEVER REASON <UNK> HAD FOR BRINGING HIS LITTLE <UNK> GROUP TO THE MISSION , HE WAS GOING TO BE IN FOR A SURPRISE .
A <UNK> OF MUSCLE `` DRAMA '' THAT IS <UNK> TO JUDGES AND <UNK> <UNK> ; ;
THE MAN WHO NOW <UNK> HER HAD STARTED THE <UNK> AS AN ORDINARY <UNK> .
BY THE TIME HE HAD <UNK> THREE <UNK> HE HAD <UNK> DOWN .
HE DID NOT ANSWER .

THE STREET THAT IS FULL NOW OF TRAFFIC AND PARKED CARS THEN AND FOR MANY YEARS <UNK> ON AN AUGUST AFTERNOON IN THE SHADE OF THE <UNK> TREES , AND SILENCE WAS A WEIGHT , ALMOST <UNK> , IN THE AIR .
THIS IS BASEBALL 1961 .

A ROAD HAD TO BE <UNK> THROUGH <UNK> FORESTS BETWEEN HANOVER AND <UNK> TO PERMIT GOVERNOR <UNK> AND A COMPANY OF GENTLEMEN TO ATTEND THE FIRST DARTMOUTH <UNK> IN <UNK> .
IT IS ONE OF THE MOST <UNK> AND <UNK> NOVELS OF THE SEASON .
SINCE AF IS <UNK> , WE FELT THAT ANY RESULTS OBTAINED FROM THE <UNK> <UNK> AF WOULD BE SUSPECT .
THE <UNK> OF THE STOMACH WAS <UNK> AND <UNK> <UNK> OVER A 14 <UNK> AREA .
OUTSIDE <UNK> <UNK> ALL EXPENSES <UNK> TO <UNK> A SALARY , COMMISSION , OR OTHER <UNK> .

HE TOOK <UNK> INTO THE ROOM HE USED AS AN OFFICE .
BUT IT IS ALSO THE <UNK> TO ONE OF THE <UNK> <UNK> IN OUR CURRENT POLITICAL HISTORY .
THE OPINION CONTINUES HERE THAT WITH A <UNK> SCHEDULE , <UNK> SPREAD THIN THROUGH A <UNK> LEAGUE AND A MOST <UNK> TARGET IN LOS <UNK> <UNK> FIELD JR. , MANTLE JUST MIGHT BREAK THE MOST <UNK> RECORD ON THE BOOKS , <UNK> <UNK> 60 <UNK> OF 1927 .

SOMETHING HAD TO BE DONE ; ;
THIS IS A <UNK> LOAD , PURE AND SIMPLE ; ;
PRESENTLY , <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> PEOPLE , DEPENDING ON THE SEASON OF THE YEAR .

<UNK> IN OUR POLITICAL <UNK> THERE IS FREEDOM TO THINK , TO EXAMINE ANY AND ALL ISSUES , AND TO SPEAK WITHOUT <UNK> .
I COULDN'T FIGHT A DOZEN OR SO OF 'EM .
THEN THE <UNK> REPLY CAME BACK FROM MANY <UNK> WITH STRIKING <UNK> .
A BRITISH OFFICER HAD COME ABOARD AND TOLD HIM THAT IN CASE OF ENEMY AIR ATTACK HE WAS NOT TO OPEN FIRE UNTIL BOMBS WERE ACTUALLY DROPPED .
`` PHIL , COME INTO MY OFFICE '' , EDDIE SAID .
THE SMALL <UNK> WITH ITS TWO STEEL <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> AND NICK RAISED UP TO WATCH IT HEADING SOUTH .
HOWEVER , A <UNK> LIVELY EYES MIGHT <UNK> .
BUT EVEN MORE IMPORTANT THAN THIS IS THE FACT THAT THE DIRECT SEARCH BY SIMULTANEOUSLY VARYING ALL OPERATING CONDITIONS HAS PRODUCED ONLY ONE OPTIMAL POLICY , NAMELY , THAT FOR THE GIVEN FEED STATE AND R STAGES .
JAZZ IS GOOD NOT ONLY BECAUSE IT <UNK> <UNK> BUT BECAUSE OF ITS DECIDED SEXUAL EFFECT .

THE DIFFUSION IS MOST <UNK> AND MOST LIKELY TO BECOME FIXED , HOWEVER , IN THOSE WHO HAVE HAD NO OR VERY MINIMAL OPPORTUNITIES TO DEVELOP THE <UNK> AND INITIATIVE THAT COULD HAVE BEEN DIRECTED INTO <UNK> EXPRESSION AND SO SERVED AS SOURCES OF DEVELOPING <UNK> .
THAT WOULD BE <UNK> , I SUPPOSE .
TABLE <UNK> <UNK> THE POINT .
SHE WAS NOT ALONE FOR THERE WERE THREE OTHER SUCH CHILDREN IN THE BIG CITY'S SPECIAL <UNK> .
AND WITH THAT HE WALKED OFF TO GIVE INSTRUCTION TO A <UNK> PITCHER .
THE <UNK> OF THE <UNK> ARE FREQUENTLY POOR PEOPLE , LIKE MR. A. , WHO <UNK> UP THEIR LIFE SAVINGS TO OFFER AS A SACRIFICE TO DOCTOR <UNK> <UNK> .

THE SAME EDITORIAL CONTINUED THAT `` WE EXPECTED TO <UNK> JAPAN AND <UNK> AND TO SEE A NEW CHINA PATTERN ITSELF EASILY ON OUR INSTITUTIONS .

THEY DRANK HALF A CUP OF THIS MORNING AND NIGHT , AND THEY ALSO WASHED AND <UNK> THEIR HANDS IN THE SAME SOLUTION .
OTHERWISE <UNK> <UNK> HIS <UNK> <UNK> FOR <UNK> <UNK> OF EMOTION -- <UNK> FIRST <UNK> , FOR EXAMPLE .

YES , THEY HAD LET SOME REPORTERS USE THEIR PHONE , BUT THEY WOULD NO LONGER .
THEIR TALK AND THEIR FEELING HAD BEEN AS DEEP AND WARM , AS <UNK> IN LIGHT , AS THE AIR AROUND THEM .
YET WAS NEVER CAUGHT UP IN IT -- NEVER A SLAVE TO ITS ACADEMIC <UNK> .
SO <UNK> DID THESE <UNK> BECOME THAT , AMONG THE <UNK> , CIVIL WAR BROKE OUT .
I'LL TAKE THE MIDDLE .
`` THE FACT REMAINS HE WAS <UNK> '' .
IN THE CENTURY FROM <UNK> TO <UNK> THE LAW OF NATIONS BECAME INTERNATIONAL LAW .
AT <UNK> , <UNK> WHAT THE TEACHER HAD SAID ABOUT MAYBE PLAYING WITH THE KIDS , JACK STAYED CLOSE TO THE <UNK> WHILE ALL THE OTHER BIG BOYS , EXCEPT CHARLES , WENT OFF OUT THE ROAD TO PLAY BALL .
`` YOU THINK THE RUSSIANS ARE GETTING AHEAD OF US IN COMEDY '' ? ?
NOW HE RECALLED IT VERY CLEARLY , AND WONDERED WHAT THE TRUCK DRIVER HAD SEEN IN THOSE EYES TO MAKE HIM BACK OFF .
WHAT MR. KENNEDY , IN FACT , WROTE WAS : `` IT IS THE <UNK> VIEW THAT NO ANTI-TRUST ENFORCEMENT CONSIDERATIONS JUSTIFY ANY LOSS OF REVENUE OF THIS PROPORTION '' .
TO PUT IT <UNK> , MANY A LOCAL CHURCH IS GIVING ITS MEMBERS ONLY WHAT THEY <UNK> WANT .
`` I'LL BE <UNK> '' , EKSTROHM SAID .
THE PRESENCE OF THE TWO <UNK> FANS SEEMED TO INDICATE THAT THE HALL COULD BECOME CROWDED FOR AIR .
<UNK> WILLIAM D. <UNK> ( D. , FIFTH ) SAID IN A LETTER TO MAYOR <UNK> THAT <UNK> AND <UNK> <UNK> SHOULD BE <UNK> EARLIER IN <UNK> AND SHOULD BE KEPT ON THE JOB LONGER THAN THEY WERE LAST MONTH .

HE CROSSED THE STREET AND WALKED <UNK> <UNK> TO CIRCLE BACK TO THE <UNK> AND NORTH A BLOCK TO THE OPEN RESTAURANT .
THE <UNK> OF THIS <UNK> BY THE <UNK> GYRO CAN BE <UNK> TO DIRECT THE PLATFORM INTO PROPER HEADING .
SHE WOULD NOT STOP TO READ THEM IN AMERICAN EXPRESS , AS MANY WERE DOING , SITTING ON <UNK> OR <UNK> AGAINST THE WALLS , BUT PUSHED HER WAY OUT INTO THE STREET .
`` <UNK> BREAD IS SO GOOD AND EVERYTHING <UNK> SO MUCH BETTER HERE THAT IT IS HARD NOT TO EAT TOO MUCH '' , SAID THE SECRETARY <UNK> <UNK> HER EXTRA POUNDS .
ALTHOUGH WE ENJOYED OUR <UNK> OF THE GOVERNMENT OFFICES IN <UNK> , WITH OFFICIALS OFFERING TEA AND <UNK> CONVERSATION IN FRENCH , WE WERE GETTING NOWHERE .
YOU WILL PROBABLY WANT TO <UNK> SOMEONE TO DO THE <UNK> , HOWEVER .
TO ESTABLISH AN <UNK> MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIP THE WORKER MUST DEMONSTRATE ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL <UNK> IMMEDIATELY , <UNK> WITHIN THE FIRST INTERVIEW , BY MEETING THE <UNK> SPECIFIC NEEDS .
IT IS AN <UNK> DEVICE INTENDED TO EASE THE TAX BURDEN OF <UNK> INCOME ; ;
A <UNK> ISSUE OF THIS SORT MIGHT DEAL WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A FREE PUBLIC JUNIOR COLLEGE IN A COMMUNITY WHERE THERE ALREADY WAS A GOOD PRIVATE COLLEGE WHICH SERVED THE MIDDLE-CLASS YOUTH <UNK> BUT WAS TOO EXPENSIVE FOR <UNK> YOUTH .
THE RESULT WAS THAT THE <UNK> CASE WAS <UNK> .

THE ULTIMATE OBJECTIVE OF AMERICAN POLICY IS TO HELP ESTABLISH A WORLD IN WHICH THERE IS THE LARGEST POSSIBLE MEASURE OF FREEDOM AND JUSTICE AND PEACE AND MATERIAL <UNK> ; ;
INDEED , THERE ARE SOME CITIES WHERE THE SUBURBAN SHOPPING <UNK> CUSTOMERS WHO ARE <UNK> MUCH <UNK> TO DOWNTOWN .
IN THE PROCESS HE WRITES AT LENGTH ABOUT MANY RELATED MATTERS : THE IMPORTANCE OF RACE , RELIGION , LOCAL TRADITION , <UNK> , ORGANIZATIONS , <UNK> VOLUNTEERS AND TELEVISION .
IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THE POSSIBILITY OF MULTIPLE OR <UNK> CLAIMS IS <UNK> REMOTE .
STATE AID TO SCHOOLS , THE <UNK> OF RAILROAD <UNK> SERVICE , THE PROPER USES OF SURPLUS FUNDS OF THE PORT OF NEW YORK AUTHORITY , AND MAKING NEW JERSEY ATTRACTIVE TO NEW INDUSTRY .
OF COURSE IT IS .
`` BUT WHY IN THE NAME OF GOD CAN'T I GIVE MY FATHER BLOOD '' ? ?
THE MEANING OF THE WORD IS QUITE PHYSICAL , TO BEGIN WITH .
MIKE YELLED TO THE <UNK> .
SUPPOSE I HADN'T BROUGHT ALONG ENOUGH MONEY ? ?
WHAT NOW ? ?
TO THIS END , THE FIRST AND <UNK> SECTION OF THE <UNK> <UNK> ALL THE LAWS <UNK> SINCE THE REVOLUTION TO <UNK> ENGLAND AGAINST THE `` ARBITRARY POWER OF A <UNK> PRINCE '' .
A QUARTER OF A CENTURY HAS GONE BY SINCE THIS <UNK> OF WALKING DREAMS <UNK> UP AND DOWN THE <UNK> OF THE OLD NEW <UNK> THEATER , <UNK> .
FOR <UNK> , NOTHING IS <UNK> .
HIS HEART SEEMED TO <UNK> AND <UNK> AGAINST THE WALL OF HIS CHEST .

HE SAID SHE WOULD ONLY HURT HERSELF .
THEY ARE <UNK> IN THE <UNK> OF TREES , WHICH HANG OVER THEM , AND APPEAR TRULY <UNK> .
ASIDE FROM THE FACT THAT BUSINESS WAS SLOW THIS TIME OF YEAR AND HIS ONE <UNK> WAS NOT THE MOST <UNK> , MR. <UNK> HAD NO WORRIES AT ALL , AND HE SAID AS MUCH TO GUN <UNK> , WHO SAT ACROSS FROM HIM IN CIVILIAN CLOTHES , ON A <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> SPECIAL ! !
WHEN HE <UNK> IT UP THE VOICE THAT CAME TO HIM WAS QUICK AND URGENT .
BUT AS CONVERSATION GOES ON , PARTICULARLY AMONG THE REALTORS THEMSELVES , ANOTHER IMAGE <UNK> , THAT OF CONSIDERABLE POWER AND INFLUENCE IN THE COMMUNITY .
<UNK> THE REORGANIZATION OF OUR FOREIGN AID STRUCTURE AND PROGRAM , THE PEACE CORPS SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED AS AN AGENCY IN THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE .
`` BEHIND THAT CHARLIE <UNK> <UNK> AND THAT <UNK> LOCK OF HAIR THAT ALWAYS COVERED HIS <UNK> , BEHIND THE <UNK> AND THE <UNK> <UNK> , THE <UNK> <UNK> AND THE OCCASIONAL DULL <UNK> <UNK> , BEHIND THE <UNK> , THE <UNK> , THE TOTAL <UNK> OF BEHAVIOR , BEHIND EVEN THE TENDENCY TO GREAT STRATEGIC <UNK> , THERE LAY A <UNK> OF NO MEAN QUALITIES : <UNK> , <UNK> , IN MANY WAYS REALISTIC , <UNK> -- LIKE <UNK> -- WITH CONSIDERABLE POWERS OF <UNK> , CAPABLE OF PLAYING HIS CARDS VERY CLOSE TO HIS CHEST WHEN HE SO DESIRED , YET BOLD AND <UNK> IN HIS DECISIONS , AND <UNK> ONE GIFT <UNK> DID NOT <UNK> : THE ABILITY TO <UNK> MEN TO FEVER PITCH OF PERSONAL <UNK> AND ENTHUSIASM BY THE POWER OF THE SPOKEN WORD '' .
UNTIL SUCH WORK IS DONE , THERE MUST REMAIN THE <UNK> SUSPICION THAT ALIENATION MAY BE LITTLE MORE THAN AN EXPRESSION OF THE <UNK> OF THE INTELLECTUAL , WHO , REJECTED BY AND IN TURN <UNK> THE LARGER SOCIETY , PROJECTS HIS OWN FEAR AND DESPAIR ONTO THE BROADER SOCIAL SCREEN .
AFTER <UNK> OUT HOW TO <UNK> THE <UNK> SO THAT THEY SHOT TO THE SAME POINT OF IMPACT , WE FIRED THIS LITTLE <UNK> JOB ON MY HOME RANGE AND IN <UNK> <UNK> TEST GALLERY .

NO .
THE MOST <UNK> THING ABOUT THE CHANCE MEETING WAS THAT HE SEEMED INTERESTED IN ME , TOO .
THE MOST REALISTIC WAY OF FACING UP TO THIS PROBLEM WOULD BE TO HAVE THE STATE TAKE OVER FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR <UNK> ALL <UNK> PROPERTY .
TO `` <UNK> '' , THE AMERICAN PEOPLE , WHO IN TWO PREVIOUS WORLD WARS WERE VERY <UNK> TO JOIN THE FIGHT , `` NOW LOOK LIKE THE NATION MOST LIKELY TO LEAD US ALL INTO A THIRD WORLD WAR '' .
